# Functional-Sequential-Keras-API

This notebook is from my deep learning learning journey from DL specialisation. </br>
In this notebook i build two models : </br>
  - Binary classification of an image (smile or not) using Sequential Keras API. </br>
  - Multiclass classification of digits signs with hands ( from 0 to 6) using Functional Keras API . </br>

**Happy Learning**
